    "description": "With a Bachelor's degree in Physical Sciences, my training exposed me to the challenge of managing large-scale databases at <1>CIEASEST</1>, which gave me a solid foundation in analysis and automation. To overcome the limitations of local infrastructure, I now specialize in AWS to design and deploy robust data pipelines in the cloud. My goal is clear: for this infrastructure to feed future AI models and agents to build systems that act in real-time on innovative solutions."
